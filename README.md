📊 Iris Dataset Analysis & Visualization
📝 Project Overview
This project involves loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the classic Iris dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python. The goal is to practice data analysis techniques and present insights using clear visualizations.

📁 Contents
iris_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations.

README.md: Project description and instructions.

📌 Tasks Performed
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.

Created a DataFrame and added species names.

Explored the structure, data types, and missing values.

Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Computed descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.).

Grouped data by species to analyze feature averages.

Noted relationships between features.

Task 3: Data Visualization
Line Chart: Simulated time-series of Sepal Length.

Bar Chart: Average Petal Length per species.

Histogram: Distribution of Sepal Width.

Scatter Plot: Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.

📈 Libraries Used
pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn.datasets

📌 Key Observations
Setosa species typically have smaller petal lengths.

Virginica has the largest petal and sepal lengths on average.

Sepal Length and Petal Length show a positive correlation.

The sepal width distribution varies slightly across samples.

🚀 How to Run
Open the project in Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda.

Run cells in sequence to execute data loading, analysis, and visualization.

Ensure all required libraries are installed.
